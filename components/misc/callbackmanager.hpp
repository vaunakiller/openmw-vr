    /// Manager of DrawCallbacks on an OSG camera.
    /// The motivation behind this class is that OSG's draw callbacks are unsafe and inherently unreliable.
    ///  - OSG does not synchronize set/add/remove DrawCallback methods, making them thread unsafe. The update thread needs to manipulate
    ///     callbacks without racing the draw thread. This class synchronizes access.
    ///  - When adding a draw callback during the update traversals of the next frame, the callback must manually compare frame numbers to avoid firing for the 
    ///     frame currently being drawn. This class automates this.
    ///  - The set*DrawCallback calls do not respect nesting and will delete any other draw callbacks. Meaning your callback will
    ///     (seemingly) randomly disappear. This class does not have this issue.
    ///  - Your must manually implement oneshot callbacks. This class automates this. \sa addCallbackOneshot, waitCallbackOneshot
    ///  - OSG draw callbacks provide no information about stereo. This class adds this information.
    /// 
    /// \note Only initial and final draw are implemented, as the render stage details would make implementing predraw/postdraw a bigger task.

        //! When rendering stereo and multiview is not enabled, this enum will correspond to the current draw traversal.

        //! 
        //! Note that every callback whose behaviour changes with stereo or number of traversals should check the value of view,
        //! even if it does not care about Stereo.
        //! For example, a common pattern is to use DrawStage::Final to sync on end of frame rendering. If run on View::Left, this will be
        //! when only one of two views has completed rendering. Instead it should be run only when the value of view is not View::Left.
